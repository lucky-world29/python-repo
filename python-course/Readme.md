# Python Overview

## What is Python?
Python is a widely used high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

### Key Uses of Python:
- **Web Development (Server-side)**
- **Software Development**
- **Mathematics and Data Science**
- **System Scripting and Automation**

### What Can Python Do?
Python is incredibly versatile, and it can be used for various purposes:
- **Web Applications**: Python can be used on a server to create and manage web applications.
- **Software Workflows**: It can integrate with other software to automate processes.
- **Database Interaction**: Python can connect to database systems and read or modify data.
- **Data Processing**: Python excels in handling big data, performing complex mathematical operations, and analyzing data.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Python's simplicity allows developers to quickly build prototypes and production-ready software.

## Why Python?


Python is favored by developers worldwide due to its unique features:

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
- **Intuitive Syntax**: Designed to be beginner-friendly and similar to the English language.
- **Concise Code**: Achieve more with fewer lines of code.
- **Versatile Paradigms**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Write and execute code instantly using its interpreter system.

---

## Python Syntax: A Quick Introduction

Python's syntax is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand:

- **No Semicolons**: Use newlines to complete commands instead of semicolons.
- **Indentation Matters**: Blocks of code are defined by indentation, not curly brackets.

### Example: Indentation
```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")  # Proper indentation
```

Skipping or inconsistent indentation leads to errors:
```python
if 5 > 2:
print("This will cause an error!")  # No indentation
```

---

## Writing and Executing Python Code

Python code can be executed directly in the **Command Line** or by running a `.py` file.  

### Example: Command Line Execution
```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

### Example: File Execution
Create a file named `myfile.py` and run it:
```bash
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```

---

## Variables in Python

Variables in Python are created by assigning a value:

### Example
```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```
- Python does **not** require explicit variable declarations.

---

## Comments in Python

Comments help document your code and are ignored during execution.

### Single-Line Comments
Use `#` to create a comment:
```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Inline Comments
```python
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

### Multiline Comments

1. **Using `#`**:
```python
# This is a comment
# spanning multiple lines
print("Hello, World!")
```

2. **Using Multiline Strings**:
```python
"""
This is another way
to write comments
spanning multiple lines.
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
> **Note**: Triple-quoted strings act as comments when not assigned to a variable.

---
=======
Python stands out for several reasons:
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: It runs on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
- **Simple Syntax**: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and closely resembles the English language, making it easy for beginners.
- **Concise Code**: Python allows developers to write fewer lines of code compared to many other languages.
- **Interpreter System**: Python code is executed as soon as it is written, allowing for rapid prototyping and iterative development.
- **Versatile Paradigms**: Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.

## Good to Know
- The most recent version of Python is **Python 3**, which will be used in this tutorial. While Python 2 is still in use, it is no longer receiving updates except for security patches.
- Python can be written in a simple text editor, but more advanced tools like **Thonny**, **PyCharm**, **NetBeans**, or **Eclipse** are helpful, especially when managing large codebases.

### Python Syntax: Simplicity and Readability
- **No Semicolons**: Python uses new lines to complete commands, unlike many other languages that rely on semicolons or parentheses.
- **Indentation for Scope**: Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define the scope of loops, functions, and classes. Other languages typically use curly brackets for this purpose.

# Python Variables

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

### Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

**Example:**
```python
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

### Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

**Example:**
```python
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

### Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the `type()` function.

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

You will learn more about data types and casting later in this tutorial.

### Single or Double Quotes?
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

**Example:**
```python
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
```

### Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.

**Example:**
This will create two variables:
```python
a = 4
A = "Sally"
# A will not overwrite a
```


# Python - Variable Names


## Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like `x` and `y`) or a more descriptive name (e.g., `age`, `carname`, `total_volume`).

### Rules for Python Variables:
1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (`A-z`, `0-9`, and `_`).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables).
5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

### Examples:
#### Legal Variable Names:
```python
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"

myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
